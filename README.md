# QSnap

This is a Next.js application for QSnap, an OCR app that extracts characters from handwritten and printed text.

#To Run the file

1. Create a ".env" file in the root of the folder
2. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey and sign up to get your Gemini API key
3. Copy the key and go back to the ".env" file created
4. Create a variable called GEMINI_API_KEY

It should look something like this: 

GEMINI_API_KEY = "Your Gemni API key"
